# Call, Bind, Apply

## Call
- Call method is used to `invoke a function directly` by passing the object reference, which points to 
    the 'this' inside the method.

## Apply
- Apply is similar to call(), the difference is it takes the `second argument as the arraylist` of the 
parameters passed in the function

## Bind
- Bind() does not invoke the function directly, it returns a copy of the exact same function we can be called
later.
